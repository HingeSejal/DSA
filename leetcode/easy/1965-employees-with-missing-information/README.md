## Problem

Table: `Employees`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.

```

 

Table: `Salaries`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.

```

 

Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with  **missing information**. The information of an employee is missing if:

- The employee's name is missing, or
- The employee's salary is missing.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`  **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+
Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
